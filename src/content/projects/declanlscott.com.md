This is my personal website (the one you're on right now). I designed and developed it from scratch using technologies like **Astro** and **Svelte**, while taking inspiration from [leerob](https://leerob.io) for brilliant features like the [guestbook](/guestbook). Astro is a fantastic web framework for static sites, but also supports rich client-side interactivity with its [islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/). I've heard a lot of positive things about Svelte, so I opted to try it out for the guestbook page.

I hope you like it! Stay tuned to my [blog](/blog), where I hope to share more about what I learn and build.
